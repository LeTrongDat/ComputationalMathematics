<h1>Gauss Elimination App </h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
    1. Dimension n <= 20 (set from a file or from the keyboard - at the choice of the end user)

    2. It should be provided for reading the initial data both from a file and entering from the keyboard.

    3. It should be possible to enter matrix coefficients both from the keyboard and from a file. Also provide for random odds.

    4. Mandatory: Test data on a large matrix (5 * 5/6 * 6 ...) + in the report with the decision

      1. Calculation of the determinant

      2. Inference of a triangular matrix (including transformed column B)

      3. Column of unknowns

      4. Column of residuals
