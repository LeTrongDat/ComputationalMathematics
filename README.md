# Gauss elimination
## Introduction

1. Dimension n <= 20 (set from a file or from the keyboard - at the choice of the end user).
2. It should be provided for reading the initial data both from a file and entering from the keyboard.
3. It should be possible to enter matrix coefficients both from the keyboard and from a file. Also provide for random odds.
4. Mandatory: Test data on a large matrix (5 * 5/6 * 6 ...) + in the report with the decision
  - Calculation of the determinant
  - Inference of a triangular matrix (including transformed column B)
  - Column of unknowns
  - Column of residuals
